How does the Internet Actually works : 
the Internet works through wires that are connected with computers all around the world 
each computer has a unique ip address which has been assigned by the ISP - ie Internet Service Provider 
its like a unique address code for each our home . 

Say for example - google the website has a similar type of ip address 142.250.188.14 it is the IP address

computers that stay online 24/7 365 days to present the website we want to access 
is known as Servers 

Client --> ISP --> DNS server (Domain Name System ) Server 

Example - Client --> wants to go to google.com ---> ISP --> DNS Server 
Dns server will give the exact ip adrress to navigate to the google website 

DNS server acts as a Phone book 

dns server will send back the ip address through the browser to your computer so that you can access the website 
then we can make a direct request to the ip adress here in the case is google.com

Summarize : 
Internet is a bunch of wires that connects every computer with each other 

underseacables are the ones which connects every computer across oceans and continents 

all we need is an ip adress so that we can access website and connect to other computers
