Project IDEA : 
An API built with users in mind: reliable, accurate, and easy-to-use
IPinfo APi

How do websites Actually works:


dns server can look up for any ip adress for any website

when we get the ip address from the dns server then we can hit up directly the website server 
to see the website and the server will send all the files and data we need to see. to be rendered on the screen 


data that we receive contains mainly of 3 types of files 
html css and js 

html is respnsible for the content of a website
its like the brick which your house is made up of 

html file contains the buttons images links 

css - these are respnsible for the colour and style of the website
ex - colour and shape of your house 
it targets all the content made by the html and applies the styling 

js- allows the website to have functionality 
ex - adding light bulbs , gas cooker , laptops in a home 

convers the static website into a functional website 
ex - sending email , music , post an image in instagram 

SO PUTTING ALL THESE TOGETHER : 

so when the browser loads up the gogle home page 

the html will make the content of the webpage 

then css - it will modify the apperance of the webpage 

js - browser gives the functionality ex - we can search terms which is the actual usage 

COMBINED TOGETHER WE MAKE MODERN WEB APPLICATION 

 we can change the local 

 when we refresh we are asking the website to send html css and js files 
 everything gets restored. so that we can render the website on our browser 

 when we edit the website using the google developer tools 
 what we are changing is the local version . and this doesnt gets saved in the server 
 so the changes does not become permanent
